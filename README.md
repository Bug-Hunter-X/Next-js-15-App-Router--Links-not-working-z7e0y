# Next.js 15 App Router: Links Not Working

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router where links, even with seemingly correct paths, fail to navigate correctly.

## Bug Description

The issue is with `next/link` component within the App Router. Despite setting correct `href` values, navigation does not happen.  This affects both internal and potentially external links.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that clicking the links does not change the page.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the application's structure and routing configuration is correctly set up for the App Router. This might include checking the `app` directory structure, the `app/page.js` content, and correct usage of `next/link`.  Additional debugging steps may be needed based on the specific application structure.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Route Configuration:**  The application may not be configured correctly to handle the routes specified in the links.
* **Conflicting Routes:**  Conflicting route definitions might be interfering with navigation.
* **Issues with `app` Directory Structure:** An improper setup of the App Router's `app` directory can prevent links from working as expected.
